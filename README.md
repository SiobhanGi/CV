## Siobhan Goggins siobhan.goggins@gmail.com

I am a junior software developer and recently graduated from Makers Academy.

As a female INTJ I’m a natural creative and logical thinker, I fell in love with coding as it’s the perfect collaboration of both worlds. My drive iis to perpetually learn new things. 

I’ve been lucky enough to be exposed to many different industries and have a keen interest in psychology, I believe my experience would offer different and deeper insights into problems to aid problem solving processes.

My desire is to work with people that share the same growth mindset, and to collaborate together to bring out the best in each other.

### Skills

#### Organizational skills

At Convince, I was responsible for a large majority of client work and Convince’s lead generation activities.

Our lack of automation limited our growth. I took it upon myself to investigate technologies that could increase our turnover, invented strategies to streamline our processes and to boost efficiency. This allowed us to take on more clients whilst maintaining our exceptional standards.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Perseverance and determination

At Ginkgo Financial I was asked to oversee their website update. I identified an array of mobile responsive problems, UX/UI issues and visual errors. 

I took it upon myself to learn WordPress, basic CSS, html, PHP in a limited amount of time and went about solving these issues personally. I was driven by sheer determination for Ginkgo to have a site they could be proud, and to push my limits.
<br/>
<br/>
#### Focused under pressure

I find the state of pressure counterproductive and strive to avoid falling under its spell. I prefer to ignore the anarchy of pressure and just get on with getting things done to meet the deadline.
