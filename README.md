### [unstructed, maybe confusing but won't want to work for someone that doesn't understand it, ] ###

The fundamental recipe of who I am is a bunch of Elon Musk’s hated acronyms, the recipe for me:

* 1 female INTJ
* Add a dash of ADHD
* Drizzle of OCD 
* Finally, decorate with the motos ‘DIY’ and ‘self-taught” 

I’m solely motivated by perpetually learning with a strong desire to face challenges both logical and creative that push me to, and beyond my limits. I want to encounter mind-boggling problems that dare blood pressure to rise, nothing is more invigorating and rewarding then overcoming problematic obstacles alone, or as a team. 

As a former digital illustrator/marketer I've been lucky enough to have been exposed to different ways of thinking. I got to work with and for a wide variety of firms in different sectors which has rewarded me with a unique insight into the world of business, and the way people think. 
 
I'm an aspiring fullstack ruby developer, one of the survivors of the Makers Academy bootcamp [lets hope this will become true]. I want to explore other languages and have a strong pull towards learning C++ and python. I’d love to be part of a team with a strong growth mentality and who are creative and challenge the conventional norm. It would be a plus if there was an open approach to dogs in the workplace...




## Skills

### Perseverance and determination

At Ginkgo Financial I was asked to take over their final phase of their website creation. I quickly identified an array of mobile responsive problems, UX/UI issues and visual errors. Ginkgo's goal was to modernize their brand which hadn't been achieved.

The website designer didn't specialise in front-end design and wasn't quite up to the task. I took it upon myself to learn WordPress, basic CSS, html, PHP in a limited amount of time and went about solving these issues myself. It wasn't smooth sailing at all, there were teething problems. I even broke the website at a point but fixed it before they found out all within the deadline.

I was driven by sheer determinion not to fail, I wanted Ginkgo to have a site they could be proud of even if it meant exceeding what was expected and asked of me.

### Focused under pressure

I don’t believe in pressure. I find the state of pressure counterproductive and strive to avoid falling under its spell. I won’t be the one running around panicking, I'll be calming people down and taking control if need be, but most importantly I'll just be getting on with things and assuring the project is finished by the deadline.

### Organizational skills

Through sheer perseverance and necessity, I made organization (my weakest skill) one of my strongest. At Convince, I was responsible for a large majority of client work and Convince’s lead generation activities, at times my workload was unrealistic.

Our problem was we couldn’t take on more work due to limited capacity, manpower and budget. I took it upon myself to investigate technologies that could increase our turnover, invented strategies to streamline our processes, increase accuracy and to boost efficiency. The result meant we could take on more clients for less money whilst maintaining a high level of personalization an our expectional standards. 

### Creative [badly written, NEEDS TO BE EDITED OR DELETED]

As a self-taught exhibiting digital artist and illustrator, I was accepted to the top London art universities and even created a weekly web comic for startup shoe brand, Gallet.

My experience as a illustrator taught to see the world through the eyes of an artist, I was able to apply this knowledge in marketing to solving UX/UI issues on websites and web-based tools which positively affected the performance most noteably of Convince's webtools.

### Analytical [not a great example, RETHINK OR DELETE] 

While working in marketing I was constantly monitoring campaigns analytics and activity and was initiatively able to predict response rates for new campaigns. When campaign performance wasn't within or exceeding expectations I'd methodically identify the possible causes and use that information to solve the problem. I was also instrumental in the development of Convince's back end system and provided the developer with a list of function requirements that were overlooked but necessary.

## Experience

**Convince** (start_date to end_date)   
*The gray space*

It’s a rewarding experience working for a developing micro business, after 5 years we still couldn’t quite work out what my role was called, so I name it “the gray space”. With the business model constantly evolving I got to get my hands dirty and help influence the direction the business should go. Most of my tasks were: 

* Contributed to the business model
* Marketing stragety – social, PPC, email
* Backend system design
* Campaign strategy, creation and implementation, including reporting
* UX/UI testing for webtools
* New business and lead generation strategy for clients and Convince
* In-charge of new technologies and training other staff members on their use.

**Ginkgo Financial** (start_date to end_date)   
*Marketing Consultant*  

Created new business campaign to other accountants, optimised their database and strategy to see a 300% decrease in the amount of times they could create reports for clients.
Marketing strategy and management, website management, landing page design, was able to create a detailed wireframe for the developer and wrote the content.  




## Hobbies and Interests

I love running, yoga and pilates, its just unfortunate I've been banned from them for a while.

Attracted to hobbies where can work with my hands, you know like hand landscaping my back garden, or building a PC.

A happy immersion addict. Things that drag you into different world where you're forced to conceptualize and theorize about subjects you'd never consider in real life. Its fascinating.
